Gazeeebo is a multifunctional school planner with features that will ease your university life as a Computer Engineering (CEG) student.
It is optimized for those who prefer to work with a keyboard rather than a mouse as it uses a CLI (Command Line Interface). 
Moreover, it does not require internet to operate. Gazeeebo will be the CEG planner you never knew you needed!
