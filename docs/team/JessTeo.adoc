== PROJECT: Gazeeebo

== Overview

My team of 5 software engineering students and I were tasked with developing a basic command line
interface application for our Software Engineering project. We chose to morph
it into a Computer Engineering (CEG) school life planner called Gazeeebo. This enhanced
application enables CEG students to plan their CEG life in university with more knowledge about the CEG course.
Gazeeebo not only has the capabilities of a normal planner, but also the ability to give you an overview of the
core modules you will need to take, thus enabling us to better plan our future schedule.
This portfolio serves to document my contribution to the project.

This the current design of Gazeeebo:

My role was to come up with a function for students to search for places in National University of Singapore (NUS)
School of Computing (SOC), design a calendar view and write the codes for the undo features. The following sections
illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have added to the user and developer
guides in relation to these enhancements.

== Summary of contributions
|===
|_This section shows the features that I have contributed to the project._
|===
* *Major Enhancement added:* *Places Page*
** What it does: It is a function for users to search for places in SOC, they can add new places, delete existing ones and list out all places.
This function allows users to locate places in SOC and easily navigate their way to the location.It allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user might be unsure of the location in their timetable,
this function enables them to easily search and locate the venue.can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement needs to be able to store and read information from a .txt file.

* *Major Enhancement added:* *Ability to undo commands*
** What it does: It allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future.
The current commands that are supported are:
• EventCommand
• TodoCommand
• DeadlineCommand
• TentativeEventCommand
• DoneCommand
• DeleteCommand
• DoAfterCommand
• TimeBoundCommand
• FixDurationCommand
• ConfirmTentativeCommand
• UndoneCommand

* *Code contributed*:Click on this link to see a sample of my code [https://nuscs2113-ay1920s1.github.io/dashboard/#search=e0309463&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2019-09-21&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false[RepoSense]]

* *Other contributions*:

** Project management:
*** Managed releases `v1.3.2`  on GitHub
** Minor enhancements to existing features:
*** Calendar View.
A monthly calendar can be print out which shows the current month and the current date, days that have tasks are
demarcated by an “*”. This function allows users to visualise and better plan their schedule.
